# P3 - Personal Porting Project

A personal project exploring different Programming Languages to implement a small program that does 8 things:

* Open a File

* Select N number of items from Array/List/Vector at Random
* Generate a String from concatenating the Randomly selecting items
* Host a Web application
* Create JSON object using Generated String
* Return JSON object on GET requests

## Goals

* Learn various Programming Languages to gauge Appropriate Use of them
* Learn different Programming Techniques
* Increase knowledge of Docker
* Test and Document Performance of Programming Languages

## Areas to Explore

* Add more Programming Languages
* Add Tests
* Add HTML and CSS to create a UI
* Document and Host on various Platforms - AWS, Heroku, etc.
* Minimise Docker Images

### Run the applications
