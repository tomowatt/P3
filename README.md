# P3 - Personal Porting Project

A personal project exploring different Programming Languages to implement a small program that does 8 things:

* Open a File
* Read File contents
* Put contents into an Array/List/Vector
* Select N number of items from Array/List/Vector at Random
* Generate a String from concatenating the Randomly selecting items
* Host a Web application
* Create JSON object using Generated String
* Return JSON object on GET requests

## Goals

* Learn various Programming Languages to gauge Appropriate Use of them
* Learn different Programming Techniques
* Increase knowledge of Docker
* Test and Document Performance of Programming Languages

## Areas to Explore

* Add more Programming Languages
* Add Tests
* Add HTML and CSS to create a UI
* Document and Host on various Platforms - AWS, Heroku, etc.
* Minimise Docker Images 

#### Run the applications:

`docker-compose up -d`

Then visit **localhost/{language}** in a Browser.
